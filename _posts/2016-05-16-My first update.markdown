This is the first page on my blog, and this is also the first time to use markdown language to write down sth for me.


{% highlight C++ %}

using namespace std;
int hello_world(){
	cout<<"hello wynn!"<<endl;
	return 0
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here is my [github home page][github home_page] and [my blog home page][my blog home_page].
